Utilizes Machine Learning and linear modeling to predict Chennai's future temperature. The model is a basic model and a chunk of the code is credited to https://youtu.be/km95-NMT6lU?si=-de6V6CRyDpe7BSS This is one of my first projects, super excited to see what the future holds

If anyone has any suggestions in terms of scalability, or upgrades that can be made to my code, let me know!

Thank you,
